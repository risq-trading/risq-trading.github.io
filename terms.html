                </h5>

<p>
    Every time you ("you" or "your") refer-a-friend or otherwise participate in the Program, you agree to be bound by the Terms that were linked to the Program Site at such time. A new binding agreement between you and Risq is created each time you refer a friend, or otherwise participate in the Program. Therefore, every time you refer a friend, or otherwise participate in the Program, you should read these Terms carefully.
Risq reserves the right to update, modify, or cancel the Program, this Agreement or any part thereof at any time without notice. You will be bound by such amended terms after such changes are posted at the Program Site and you refer-a-friend or otherwise participate in the program. Therefore, we encourage you to visit the Program Site regularly and check the terms and conditions contained in the version of the Agreement in force at such time. Your continued participation in the Program shall be deemed to attest to your agreement to any amendments to the Agreement.
You confirm that you have read the Agreement, have had an opportunity to consult with your own legal advisors if so desired, and agree to all of its terms and conditions. You confirm that you have independently evaluated the desirability of participating in the Program and you are not relying on any representations, guarantee or statement other than as set forth in this Agreement or any other marketing materials.

<h5>
    INVITATION OPTIONS
</h5>
<p>
    The Program offers several ways to invite friends to play on the Website. All options are detailed on the Program Site. All options incorporate the use of a Link, which tracks the invitations you will be sending, as well as the performance status of your Referred Friend(s). Referred Friends will only be credited to you if the Referred Friend(s) create a Risq account after clicking on a Link and successfully completes a Committed Action .
